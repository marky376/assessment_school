# Student Report Form Generator (assessment_school)

## Description

This project, `assessment_school.py`, is a simple Python script that allows users to generate a student report form. It prompts the user to enter the student's name, grade, and a performance rating (on a scale of 1 to 5). Based on this input, it then generates and prints a formatted report card, including a descriptive interpretation of the performance rating.

## Files

* `assessment_school.py`: The main Python script containing the program logic.
* `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  Save the Python code into a file named `assessment_school.py`.
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
5.  Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python assessment_school.py
    ```

6.  The script will then prompt you to enter the student's details:
    * Student's name
    * Student's grade (e.g., A, B, C)
    * Student's performance rating (a number from 1 to 5)

7.  After providing the inputs, the script will display the formatted student report.
